        The most powerful tool a writer can have is a great editor. A great
        editor can uncover the diamond in the rough. And while it may be painful
        to have someone chip away at your manuscript to reveal the gem beneath,
        there is no better person on earth to help transition your story from a
        wonderful idea to a legible masterpiece.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that my editor’s name
        popped into my head the moment I decided I wanted to add interviews to
        my web content.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        One of the first times I communicated with Lynne was when she responded
        to, and promptly recommended edits for, one of my posts on Instagram.
        Some people would have gotten upset by having a stranger recommend
        corrections and improvements to a post, but I saw it for the beautiful
        gift it was.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        There are two reasons I was happy for the recommendations instead of
        feeling indignant. One, it’s my firm belief that any and every writer
        should welcome critique with a smile and an open mind. And two, her
        recommendations were damn good! So instead of being put off, I thanked
        her and implemented the changes she recommended.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        As I continued to post snippets from my debut novel, Lynne continued to
        pop up with helpful and insightful suggestions, and quickly became the
        person I wanted to hire for all my editing needs. To date, she has been
        the editor for Pray: Hunting Party – The Nurse, The True Tale of Peter
        Piper, and the second edition release of my debut novel - Prey/Pray:
        Origin of The Average Man.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Lynne is one of those people whose passion also lines up with her
        profession, so much so that when I asked her if she would take part in
        this interview she replied with: “I am happy to do that for you. I may
        edit your questions…”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        So, without further ado, I present to you Lynne Person and my edited
        questions:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> Lynne, thanks again for agreeing to
        do this interview. I think editing is one of those scary things both
        self-published and traditional authors deal with, and I’m hoping this
        will help other writers realize editors aren’t inherently evil and what
        exactly it is that a good editor can offer. Now I know there are
        different types of editing, but can you give us a rundown of the editing
        you provide and what the different types mean?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> Sure. A copy edit is the simplest
        level of editing I offer. That’s correcting errors in capitalization,
        spelling, grammar, and punctuation. There are many writing programs that
        can do that. What a human editor will do is check for consistency – the
        name of a character is always spelled correctly. For example, my name is
        Lynne with an E. Yet it can be spelled Lyn, Lynn, Linn. Most software
        programs are not going to pick that up. A good copy editor will. I will
        also query the writer about factual inconsistencies and word choice. A
        writer may use a word that I’m not familiar with or use it in a way that
        is uncommon. That doesn’t make the word wrong, I just point it out and
        let them decide.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The next level of editing I provide is a line edit. It includes
        everything in a copy edit but then I dive a little deeper. I look at
        timeline, character descriptions, and plot points. I will suggest
        rewriting sentences and paragraphs for clarity, improve the pace, and
        deepen the emotion. I bring to the writer’s attention anything I think
        will bump the reader out of the story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A manuscript critique is an evaluation of the story itself. Does the
        character have clearly defined goals? Are there gaping plot holes? What
        is the inciting incident and does the story actually start there? I may
        suggest adding conflict, shifting scenes, changing point of view. It is
        a thorough evaluation. I don’t make copy edit corrections on this level
        because I want the writer to focus on the story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> I mentioned in the introduction
        that your passion lines up with your profession, and from the
        conversations we’ve had, I think it’s fair to say that editing really is
        a passion for you. When did you first realize that you were passionate
        about editing?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> I was invited to a neighbourhood
        book group where a local author would be speaking about her novel. I
        noticed inconsistencies but did not mention them to the author. At this
        point there wasn’t a darn thing she could do about them – the book was
        in print – but other people did. I joined that author’s newsletter and a
        few months later she shared the first few chapters of her current work
        in progress. I found inconsistencies in the story – it was set in the
        past – and she referenced events that hadn’t happened yet. I had no idea
        how to contact her. That led me to thinking I should offer my services
        as a reader to her publisher and it dawned on me that editing was a
        career that interested me. Writers work so darn hard to get their
        stories out there and who wants their work derailed by typos and
        mistakes? Funny story, that author became a client.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> And how long have you been editing?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> I finished my editing program from
        University of Washington in June of 2016 and hung up my shingle that
        fall.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> In the introduction, I also
        mentioned that some of our first conversations revolved around edits you
        recommended for some parts of my book that I was posting online. Is that
        something you’ve done with a lot of others?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> Nope. Only one other person.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> What is it that makes you reach out
        and offer to help in a situation like that?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> Respect for writers, and a sincere
        desire to see them present the best book they possibly can. Also the way
        you presented yourself. Your posts are engaging and I saw something I
        could help with so I did.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> For me, one thing that really
        impressed me about you is you never did any type of hard pitch for your
        services. It never felt like you were offering suggestions just to get
        me to pay you for your skills, and if I’m remembering correctly, I think
        I approached you about taking me on as a client and not the other way
        around. Having grown up in sales, it was really refreshing to see that
        you let your skills speak for themselves instead of pushing a sales
        pitch. Have you come across a lot of clients by just being yourself and
        letting your inner editor come through naturally?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> I suppose. I’ve never thought of
        it that way. If someone is having an issue with their book and asks me a
        question, I’m happy to help.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> When it comes to your clients, I
        know you work with more than just thriller writers like myself, what
        different genres have you worked with?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> Memoirs, mysteries, women’s
        fiction, dystopia, fantasy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> Do you have a favorite genre to
        work with?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> The majority of my work comes from
        romance writers. I love a happy ever after story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> Are there any genres that you won’t
        work with, and if so, why?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> I haven’t encountered one yet. Not
        sure if I have the skill set for sci-fi though. I’m not a fan of books
        with sexual violence so I might turn that down.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> One of the many things I think you
        handle amazingly well, is protecting the voice of the writer. A fear I
        had going into hiring an editor, and a fear I’m sure other writers have
        experienced, is worrying that an editor would change their story to the
        point where it didn’t seem like their writing anymore. Is that a skill
        set you’ve always had, or is something you’ve had to develop?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> I think it has to be developed. An
        editor has to remember that it is not their book. Starting out, I had
        conversations with writers where I was overstepping and I had to pull
        back. Now, if I see something that I think needs a drastic change, I
        will talk with the writer first. I tell writers that my edits are
        suggestions and it is up to them whether or not they accept them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> Is it difficult to maintain a
        writer’s voice that isn’t your own?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> Yes. But it’s a challenge I fully
        embrace.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">Dicky:</span> I’ve been through the process with
        you a couple times now, so I’m developing a better understanding of it,
        but for those who haven’t worked with a professional editor, walk me
        through the steps you take for editing and how you work with the writer
        to improve their story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">Lynne:</span> I start off with a conversation.
        Preferably a video chat. Stuck in my little office, I like to see faces.
        I ask authors about their writing background, their publishing goals,
        their concerns. Then we determine the level of editing they require. I
        download the manuscript onto my kindle so I’m not tempted to start
        editing right away. The first editing pass starts with running the
        manuscript through PefectIt. That helps with inconsistencies. Then I go
        through the book sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph. I edit in
        Word. I use the comment bubbles to make suggestions, point out issues,
        and query the author. When I finish the first round, I create a Style
        Sheet. It includes suggestions for improvement, the reasoning for my
        edits, and is a printout of all the comments I’ve made in the
        manuscript. I schedule another conversation with the author to go over
        the Style Sheet. Then I send that off to the author with the marked-up
        manuscript for them to make revisions. When they complete their
        revisions, they send it back to me. I read it one more time and clean it
        up. Then I return it to the author.
