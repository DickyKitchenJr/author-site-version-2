          A Retrospective Look at My First Year Self-Publishing
        </h3>
      </div>

      <p className="blog-p">
        It took 17 years to write and self-publish my first book. What stated as
        a short piece of writing in 2003, would become the second chapter in my
        2020 debut novel - Prey/Pray: Origin of The Average Man.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Looking back on that time, I’d love to say it took so long to complete
        because I regularly worked on it and tweaked the book, searching for
        perfection in the story over those 17 years. But in reality, I spent the
        time dragging my feet and ignoring the voice in my head telling me to
        finish writing the story.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        In truth, I never wrote the story intending to publish it. As well
        received as the book has been, it was only originally meant to be
        written for my entertainment and maybe to share with a friend or two. I
        didn’t even have the idea to publish it until I completed the story,
        which made marketing the book a much slower and more painful process,
        but that’s a discussion for another day.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Thinking about it now, I wonder what I would tell my younger self about
        the book and the process. What would my 40-year-old self tell my
        22-year-old self one year after having published my first book and
        having had the time to look back on everything? Let’s find out…

        <span className="guest">22:</span> Yeah. I just wrote that. Not sure I’m

        <span className="guest">22:</span> That’s great! How long did it take to

      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> 17 years.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> A few things got in our way. We
        focused on other things in life, we didn’t believe we could actually
        finish it, and in a few years you’re going to hear about a show called
        ‘Dexter’ and think the premise of the show is too similar to what you
        have in mind for the story. You’ll actually go out of your way to never
        watch the show, just to make sure no one can accuse you of copying the
        idea.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">22:</span> Ok, well now that I know all of that,
        I can change it right? I can just go back and work on it more right
        away. Or did it suck and I shouldn’t bother?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> No, actually it turned out great. It’s
        getting fantastic reviews. But, no, you can’t go back and change
        anything. That’s not how these sorts of things work. Changing the future
        would prevent you from ever having this conversation, and so you’d never
        change the future. Besides, you’ll forget all of this when you go back
        to your time.

      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> No, you actually decide to

        <span className="self">40:</span> Yeah, it’s actually a pretty big thing
        in my time. Millions of people choose to self-publish.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">22:</span> Why do I do it?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> By the time you decide to publish, you
        really want full control over the story. Instead of risking a
        traditional publisher telling you to make changes, you decide to do it
        all yourself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">22:</span> Was it the right decision?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> Hard to say at this point.
        Self-publishing is definitely harder than traditional publishing because
        of how much you have to do on your own. Marketing is probably easier
        with traditional publishing, as long as you get a good publisher. And
        the initial cost of self-publishing is more than you’d expect, but it’s
        necessary to make sure the book appears professional as the
        traditionally published alternatives. But on the flip side, you get
        higher royalties self-publishing and own all the rights to your book and
        characters. At only a year out from the release date, it’s still too
        early to say if self-publishing was the best decision.

      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="guest">22:</span> So we’re not famous?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> **chuckles** Nah, not yet. But who
        knows? It could happen. Getting a book in the hands of readers takes a
        lot of time and effort. It’s a bit of a never-ending process. And when
        it really comes down to it, one book alone seldom gets a writer big
        recognition. Typically, an author has several books written before they
        really get noticed.

      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        <span className="self">40:</span> Actually, you’ve already published
        your first 3 books. The one you just started writing inspires you to
        write a companion book exploring the back stories of the characters
        created in the first book. You released the first part of that as your
        second published book, and then you wrote a kid’s book and published it
        with an author who is also an illustrator.
