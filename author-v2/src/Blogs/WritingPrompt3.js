        Every week a new writing prompt is added to the BookInd community. The
        rules are simple - use the prompt or it's essence to create a short
        piece of writing. The following is one such prompt and my subsequent use
        of the prompt:

        Writing Prompt - Two characters square off in a fight or challenge that
        will define how their future plays out. However, one of them is suddenly
        slowed down or stopped entirely by the most mundane or ridiculous reason
        they can think of...
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The fight had gone on for what felt like hours. The home in shambles, a
        testament to the war the two men had fought with each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Twelve rounds of 9mm and ten rounds of 38mm had pock marked the walls,
        miraculously missing both men. Both guns ran dry before being used as
        melee weapons.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A cast iron frying pan remained suspended from the dry wall, barely
        missing the head of one of the men as it whizzed through the air.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Doors hung from their hinges, holes and cracks from both men being
        thrown into them at various moments of the altercation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Furniture had been flipped, tables smashed, and lamps shattered.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Ground zero for a brawl that would leave most, if not both, combatants
        dead.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        And yet they stood bloody and beaten, the only energy remaining provided
        by their primal urge to survive, facing each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        No words were exchanged. No words were needed. The understanding was
        clear. They wanted to kill each other.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Peter crossed the wrong clients, and Eugene was the person sent in to
        erase those who made that mistake.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The brief pause in violence was broken by a haymaker flying towards
        Eugene’s head, thrown out of exhaustion and desperation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Eugene ducked the punch and countered with a right cross, connecting
        squarely in Peter’s midsection, and forcing what little air remained in
        his lungs to violently expel as he lurched backwards and collapsed
        against a bookshelf.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s over,” Eugene stated, “This could have been done quick with a
        bullet, but you had to go and fight back. I never would have guessed a
        dweeb like you could have caused this much trouble.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Peter glared up, the only reply he could make while his body re-learned
        to process air.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Eugene braced his hands on the bookshelf, too tired to trust his own
        balance, and raised his foot to stomp down on the defenseless target.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Defiantly Peter stared up, but he knew he didn’t have the energy to
        evade the terrible fate to come.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Still, he had given it his best. He refused to show any fear even here
        at the end.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Expecting to feel the first of several crushing stomps that would end
        his life, Peter instead found himself staring at an astonished look on
        Eugene’s face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “What are you waiting for?” Peter wheezed; his breathing still labored
        by the previous blow.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Is that…” Eugene cocked his head to the side and peered at something
        behind Peter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Puzzled, Peter just continued to stare up.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Is that a copy of The Amazing Spider-Man #299, released in April 1988?
        The first appearance of Eddie Brock as Venom?” Eugene asked.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Perplexed, Peter slowly glanced over his shoulder seeing the comic in
        its protective wooden from sitting on the bookshelf his head rested on.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Yeah, signed by Todd McFarlane.” Peter said, returning his eyes to
        Eugene.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “No freaking way.” Eugene gasped, putting his foot down taking a step
        back.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The two stared at each other for a moment before Peter broke the
        silence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s one of two copies I own. I keep the other locked up.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Wow.” Eugene stated, the killer’s face adopting a more boyish
        expression.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Do you…” Peter paused a second, “Do you want that copy?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Seriously?” Eugene looked like he just won the science fair.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Well, yeah. I mean, if it ends…” Peter gestured around with his hand,
        highlighting the devastation surrounding them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Eugene looked around at the mayhem that surrounded them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“You’ve got a deal.”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Peter cautiously raised from the ground and handed the framed comic to
        Eugene.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Man, this is just… wow.” Eugene said grinning down at the comic.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        As the totality of the situation sank in, Eugene glanced at the front
        door.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I’m going to leave now. Um…” he shrugged and backed towards the door.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Peter stared as the man stepped over rubble towards the door.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        As he began to step through the threshold and exit the home, Eugene
        looked back over his shoulder at Peter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Listen, Pete…” he began, “you should consider leaving. Me failing here
        doesn’t mean they’ll stop.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“I know.” Peter replied.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “The Six are coming for you Pete,” Eugene gave one more look at the
        destruction in the home, “Sorry about the mess.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Eugene shut the door behind him, and Peter collapsed to the floor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Saved by Spider-Man,” Peter sighed, “Not how I saw my day going.”
      </p>
      <br />
    </>
