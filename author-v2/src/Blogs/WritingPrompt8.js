      <p className="blog-p">Darkness turned to light.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Blurred images began to form, and with it, pain.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        His head throbbed and swam with confusion as he tried to place his
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The last thing he remembered was going for a walk to get to know his new
        environment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">He remembered looking down a dark alley…</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">But then what?</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        He vaguely remembered a loud noise and a sting at the base of his skull
        before the world went black.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Struggling to focus, his surroundings began to dance into focus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        He found himself sitting in a wooden chair, and tried to push himself up
        only to be pulled back down.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A pinch in his wrist caused him to look down, and he saw a pair of
        handcuffs on each wrist, locking him to the arms of the wooden chair.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Good, sinner. You are awake. We may begin.” A voice spoke behind him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Still groggy, he jumped at the sound of the voice.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Where am I?” he forced his voice to ask.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “You are where all sinners eventually find themselves. You are at the
        gates of hell. But fear not. I will purge the sin from you and send you
        to our lord clean and reborn.” The voice spoke from over his shoulder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        With the drama of a Shakespearean actor, a man walked from behind him.
        Each foot planting with a slow methodical intention dripping with
        pseudo-showmanship.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        He looked over the man, noting the stained robe and askew clerical
        collar he wore.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        His shoulders drooped and he shook the rest of the cobwebs from his
        head.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        With new clarity, he pulled at his bindings, testing the strength of the
        handcuffs latching him to the chair.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “There is no use struggling child. You will be delivered from these
        mortal coils. The fire will cleanse you.” His captor said.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Fire?” he asked, tensing in the chair.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The death cleric continued his exaggerated walk to a sheet covered table
        and yanked the sheet off, revealing a propane torch.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        His blood pumped faster at the sight of the torch and his eyes darted
        around the room looking for any source of salvation from what was about
        to become a very painful experience. That’s when he noticed it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A chuckle escaped his mouth, and the death cleric’s dramatic performance
        faltered as a look of confusion crossed his face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “You find this funny, sinner?” the death cleric asked.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s just that…” he began, then dropped his head and began to whisper
        mumbles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The death cleric drew closer, leaning down to put his ears closer to his
        captive’s voice.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “What sinner? Speak up.” The death cleric insisted.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        He raised his head, becoming eye to eye with the death cleric, and a
        grin spread over his face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I said, you forgot to shackle my feet, amateur.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        With an explosion of movement he pushed off both feet, launching himself
        into the air and thrusting his knees into the death cleric’s jaw.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The surprise impact caused the death cleric to fly backwards, his feet
        losing purchase with the floor, and he came crashing down, all his air
        evacuating his lungs with the impact.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Crashing down from his attack, the chair shattered and quickly freed the
        wooden chunks from the ends of the handcuffs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Standing from the loose pile of broken and splintered wood, he stood,
        empty ends of the handcuffs swinging loosely from each wrist.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Pain radiated out from his wrist as blood trickled down, and yet he
        smiled.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “What is it with the religious spin and fire? Do all of you nut jobs
        subscribe to the same magazines or something?” he said grinning down on
        the death cleric.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        He took a few steps back, giving the death cleric room to stand, then
        placed the open end of each handcuff in his hands. Turning what was once
        his restraints into a makeshift pair of brass knuckles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Confusion melted to rage, and the death cleric shot up from the ground
        and scrambled for the torch on the table.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A metal laden punch came down on the death cleric’s knuckles as he
        reached out to grasp the torch.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Nope. Try again.” he derided the death cleric, watching as the would-be
        killer withdrew his hand in pain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The death cleric lunged at him, and was rewarded with several metallic
        punches to the face.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The handcuffs tore chunks from the death clerics face with each blow,
        and forced him to the ground.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Looking up from the ground, the death cleric wondered how things had
        gone so wrong with his plan. He had always made a point to pick the most
        unremarkable victims possible, knowing that they wouldn’t pose a threat
        to him, and this man standing above him was no different.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        There was nothing at all that would have indicated this man would have
        been capable of besting him, he was just so… average.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The Average Man stood above the death cleric, and pushed the empty ends
        of the handcuffs, opening each to a hook.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “There’s a ‘teach a man to fish’ joke in here somewhere.” He said
        smiling down.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Then he drove the hooks down into the beaten death cleric’s neck and
        yanked back until the ripped free.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Dripping with blood not his own, he looked around at his surroundings as
        his victim lay bleeding out at his feet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Raising his hands, he stared at the dripping handcuffs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Now how am I going to get these things off?”</p>
      <br />
