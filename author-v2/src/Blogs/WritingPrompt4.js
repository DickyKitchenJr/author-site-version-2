      <p className="blog-p">
        On a break from college Alice and Danny decided to take a road trip
        across the state, but four hours into the trip the car had broken down.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The bleak road the car died on offered little in help, with no cell
        phone reception and an empty field on both sides. Empty save for a lone
        house seen in the distance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A single wooden post impaled into the ground with the words “Keep Out”
        in chipped red paint stood on the property’s perimeter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        There was a brief conversation about respecting the sign’s request, but
        with no cars seen traveling the road and darkness quickly approaching,
        the couple agreed to walk through the field in hopes of finding help at
        the house in the distance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        As Alice and Danny pushed through the thick reeds and stalks of the
        field, Alice had frozen at a sound.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“What is it?” Danny asked.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I don’t know,” Alice replied, “I thought I just heard whispering.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Danny glanced around, but after seeing nothing but vegetation,
        encouraged Alice to keep moving.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        After several minutes, Alice heard the whisper again, and grabbed Danny
        by the arm.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“You don’t hear that?”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Hear what?”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Danny’s face furrowed in confusion.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “The whispering! I think we should go back to the car. Somethings not
        right. There’s someone out here. Let’s just go back to the car and wait
        for someone to drive by.” Alice pleaded.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Alice you’re just being paranoid. It’s just the wind blowing through
        the plants. There’s nothing out he…”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A blur erupted out of the vegetation to Danny’s right, and his body flew
        into the air, a pink mist floating in the space he occupied a second
        before.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice stood in shock, the taste of copper on her tongue, and looked down
        where Danny landed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A red puddle formed under Danny, a look of disbelief on his face as he
        gasped for air.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        He put a hand on the ground to push himself up, but only the top half
        moved. Sinews separated releasing his intestines onto the ground,
        revealing a jagged tear across his midsection.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Danny screamed as pain washed over him.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice’s panic-stricken eyes darted around, her mind trying to process
        what occurred just seconds before.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Emerging from the reeds behind Danny, a beast’s snout slowly came into
        view.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Black fur covered the creature and its bright red eyes pierced the night
        as it crept towards Danny.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Placing a clawed hand on Danny’s legs, the creature drove its maw into
        his back. A horrid crack echoed out as the beast’s teeth snapped through
        Danny’s spine, its victim bellowing in pain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        With a shake of its head, the beast separated the remaining flesh
        connecting the two halves of Danny, his organs the only remaining
        connection between the gruesome blood-drenched sides.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice shrieked in horror at the scene before her.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The beast released Danny and glanced up at Alice, a smirk painted across
        its blood-soaked muzzle.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The creature turned its head back to its victim and gingerly grabbed
        Danny’s left leg in his mouth. Then looking back at Alice, bit down with
        a cruel slowness so that she could see its fangs dig into Danny’s flesh
        before sprinting off into the vegetation that surrounded them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Time froze as Alice stared down at Danny’s top half, intestines
        stretching out in the direction the beast had just disappeared, before
        the tension of his organs finally reached the apex of their elasticity
        and the remainder of his body was dragged off to follow.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Panicked energy found Alice’s feet and she sprinted in the opposite
        direction, survival her only thought.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        She ran until her lungs burned. Vegetation whipped her body as she burst
        through the field leaving welts and scratches on all exposed skin.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Stray roots challenged her steps until momentum stole her balance.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice hit the ground hard, heart beats pounding in her ears.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Frantic she looked around and found the house just a few yards away.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        It appeared much more dilapidated from this distance, but its offer of
        protection from the beast seemed a fortress compared to the vegetation
        around her.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice clawed herself up to a crouched position and scanned her
        surroundings for the beast.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        A familiar whisper danced across the air and Alice’s feet began to move
        without her willing them to do so.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Bounding up the steps two at a time, Alice grabbed the front door and
        burst into the home, unsure if the door had been unlocked or if she had
        broken in.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Secure within the home’s walls she hurried to push the door shut and
        leaned her back against it, collapsing as she did.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice sat breathless against the old wooden door and listened for any
        sign of the beast.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        As her pulse calmed, she looked around the old home.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Its ramshackle interior covered in dust and cobwebs, speaking to a void
        of any life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Silent moments passed as Alice’s pulse began to lower.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Her calm was broken by a childish giggle from somewhere upstairs in the
        home.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “H-h-hello?” Alice said as tears filled her eyes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Sammy must have really liked you. He doesn’t usually let people get to
        the house.” a little girl’s voice echoed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Sammy?” Alice’s voice cracked as the words left her mouth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“My pet silly.” the voice giggled in reply.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice pushed herself to her feet, eyes shooting around the home looking
        for anything she could use to protect herself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Oh, it’s too late for that.” the voice stated taking a darker edge.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">A click sounded behind Alice as the door locked.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Alice yanked at the door desperate to escape the new threat.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Don’t try to run away. You’re my new toy.” the once child-like voice
        growled.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        As the sun set, a shutter passed through the old home and Alice’s
        screams could be heard for miles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">If only there were someone to hear them…</p>
      <br />
