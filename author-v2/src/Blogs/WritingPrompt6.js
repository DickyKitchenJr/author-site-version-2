      <p className="blog-p">
        Muffled conversations leaked from behind the wooden door, a sign reading
        “LSA. New members welcome” taped to the front.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Stan stood, arms at his side, fist clenched, nervousness flowing through
        his veins as he debated entering the room.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy.” He mumbled.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Stan shook his head and clenched his fist tighter.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “No. That’s why you’re here. You promised everyone you’d try to change.
        Your New Year’s resolution was to change. You have to do this. You have
        to try.” He said, steeling his nerves.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Reaching his hand out, he gripped the door and pulled it open.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The noisy room silenced as he entered. Several people sat in a large
        circle of chairs facing each other, all looking at Stan as he stood
        frozen in the doorway.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Haven’t you people ever heard of closing the…”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Ryan! We’ve talked about this. That is not how you great new members.”
        A man said as he stood from his chair, cutting off the words of the
        first.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Sorry doc. I’m still working on it.” Ryan replied.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I’m not a doctor. We’ve also been over that. I’m just a counselor
        trying to help guide you all to a healthier life. I do not have my
        doctorate.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The man’s face softened as he approached Stan and he extended his hand
        to shake.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Welcome. I’m Eddie. Come in and grab a chair. Coffee is in the corner
        on the table if you want some. We were just getting started.” Eddie
        said, grabbing Stan’s hand.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Um. Thanks Eddie. I’m Stan.” He replied, returning the hand shake.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The two walked over to the circle of chairs and sat.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The group of people settled into their chairs as Stan glanced around at
        all the faces, noticing the familiar shame in their eyes.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        One older man sat alone by a window and stared aimlessly out.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Is he not part of this?” Stan asked nervously.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “That’s Otis. Well, at least that’s what we call him.” Eddie began, “His
        family drops him off to every meeting, but we’re still trying to
        convince him to come join us. Otis, do you want to bring your chair over
        to the circle and join in today?”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Sittin’ in the mornin’ sun. I’ll be sittin’ when the evenin’ comes.
        Watching the ships roll in. Then I watch ‘em roll away again.” Otis
        replied.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Eddie sighed.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Otis, it’s five in the evening. We’re way past the morning sun. And the
        nearest body of water is over 100 miles away, so you aren’t watching any
        ships. Your family cares about you. One day you should really join us.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Otis started to whistle.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Ok,” Eddie sighed again. “Let’s just get started.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Eddie stood and motioned for the others to join him. One by one they
        each stood.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Welcome to Lyric Speakers Anonymous. If you’ll all repeat after me. We
        are not the songs. We have our own voices.” Eddie said.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">In unison the group echoed his words.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“We are not the songs. We have our own voices.”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Good. Good. Ok. Who wants to begin tonight?” Eddie said, glancing
        around the group.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Everyone remained seated, nervously fidgeting as they waited for the
        first brave volunteer to speak.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">After a moment, a young woman stood.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Um, hi.” She said, wringing her hands.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “My names Maggie and I’m addicted to speaking in lyrics.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Hi Maggie.” Several other members said.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s been two days since I last used lyrics to speak instead of just
        talking. It’s been tough. I know it upsets my family, and all my friends
        have all but disowned me, but it’s just… it’s just…” her voice trailed
        off.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s ok Maggie. We all know it’s hard.” Eddie said, encouragement in
        his voice.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s just that, every morning I just look in the mirror and…” she
        paused for a moment, then “tell the mirror what you know she’s heard
        before. I don’t wanna be you. I don’t wanna be you. I don’t wanna be you
        anymore.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Eddie drops his head, shaking it slowly.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “You just did it again, didn’t you Maggie?” he said.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Maggie shamefully nods and sits down silently.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s ok.” Eddie said, taking a deep breath to release his frustrations
        with the moment.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Ok. Who is next?”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“I’ll go next doc.” A man said as he stood.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I’m not a doctor… you know what, never mind.” Eddie mumbled.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “My name is Chris and it’s been a few hours since I used lyrics instead
        of my own words.” The man said.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Hi Chris.” The room replied.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Chris looks around solemnly.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Well I guess I was wrong. I just don’t belong. But then I’ve been there
        before. Everything’s all right. I’ll just say goodnight and I’ll show my
        self to the door.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Chris, sit down.” Eddie grumbled.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I’m sorry doc. I’m trying, I really am.” Chris said as he lowered back
        into his chair.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Eddie rolled his eyes.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Listen, I know this is difficult, but every meeting can’t be this way.
        You all have to try harder to…”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Oooh AHHH AHH AHH AHH!” a seated man blurted out, causing everyone in
        the room to tense.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“LEE!” Eddie shouted.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Sorry. I can’t hold in the lyrics when I get nervous. It’s why my wife
        left me… the divorce court was a nightmare.” The man who just blurted
        out replied.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “The thrill is gone. The thrill is gone away.” Another member muttered
        before clasping her hands over her mouth.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “No! We’re not having a chain reaction. Everyone just calm down. Take a
        breath. We can get through this together. We have our own voices!” Eddie
        said, teetering on the edge of his own frustrations.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">The room grew silent.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Um…” Stan said, standing nervously from his chair.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Eddie clasped his hands and looked up at Stan, eyes full of hope.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Yes, our newest member wants to share. Please do.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Stan breathed deep.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I’m Stan. This is my first time here, so I’m not really used to this,”
        Stan said, head down, eyes on the floor in front of him.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “But,” he continued, “I think I understand this. It’s tough being like
        this. Always struggling. Always fighting it.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Yes. Yes. Exactly Stan. You’ve got this. Please continue” Eddie beamed
        with hope.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “The thing is…” Stan looked around, “You’ve got to lose yourself in the
        music, the moment you own it. You better never let it go!”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Of for f@#!’s sake!” Eddie threw his arms in the air.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">The room erupted in various lyrics.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“What looks so strong, so delicate!”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Some days I just wanna leave the negativity in my head, I just want
        relief from my stress”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Because I’m happy”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“All my friends are heathens, take it slow”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Hats off to the bull!”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“I’m gonna break my rusty cage and run”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“I want to paint it black”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “I wish I would have met you, but now it’s a little late”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder”</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Old sawbones got some age on him, that’s why you show respect”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Something told me it was over, when I saw you and her talkin’ ”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “ENOUGH!” Eddie’s voice shattered the room, forcing silence where chaos
        had just existed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “You just don’t get it,” Eddie continued, falling to his knees “You just
        don’t get it…”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">All eyes fell on Eddie.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “Daddy didn’t give attention,” Eddie began, “to the fact that mommy
        didn’t care”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">A gasp filled the room.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“You’re one of us?” an old voice asked.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        The room turned to see Otis standing, eyes glued to Eddie.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">Eddie nodded.</p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        “It’s ok son. We get it. Nobody knows you when you’re down and out.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">
        Stan looked around at the crowd of broken people.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="blog-p">“Maybe next year” he shrugged.</p>
